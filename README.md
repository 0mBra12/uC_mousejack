-------------

Microcontroller Mousejack is a project to get [Mousejack](https://www.mousejack.com) attacks into a small embedded device, with the form factor of a key chain.

Our first iteration uses an [Adafruit Feather 32u4 protoboard](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2771) and a SPI-based [NRF24L01+ module](http://www.icstation.com/22dbm-100mw-nrf24l01ppalna-wireless-transmission-module-p-4677.html).

Building the device is straight-forward, and the code provides a tool to use Duckyscript to launch automated keystroke injection attacks against Microsoft and Logitech devices.

Build instructions will be posted in the next few days.
